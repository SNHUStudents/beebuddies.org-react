The Bee Buddies campaign will focus on education and fundraising during March, and participants will plant their seeds on Earth Day Weekend: April 22nd, 23rd, 24th. We highly encourage our participants to reach out to their community and plant their seeds in an area that will benefit others. It’s important to note that all planting should be done with the landowners' permission. Participants are welcome to plant on their property if community planting is not possible. Become a Bee Buddy today and help feed the bees.",

We ask that you plant on Earth Day weekend and consider sharing pictures of the process. Our movement will grow if we can create a buzz around our Bee Beedies. Each package comes with a memento for our participants to keep. Lastly, please consider joining us next year too, as we hope for this to be an annual event.",
