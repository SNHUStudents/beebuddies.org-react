        "description": "Our service project was born out of SNHU’s Global Days of Service movement. These student-driven projects take place during March and April each year. The Bee Buddies campaign will focus on education and fundraising during March, and participants will plant their seeds on Earth Day Weekend: April 22nd, 23rd, 24th. We highly encourage our participants to reach out to their community and plant their seeds in an area that will benefit others. It’s important to note that all planting should be done with the landowners' permission. Participants are welcome to plant on their property if community planting is not possible. Become a Bee Buddy today and help feed the bees.",

    "description": "To become a Bee Buddy, all you need to do is purchase a package. Each package comes with a set amount of bee-appropriate seeds and a momento for our participants to keep. We ask that you plant on Earth Day weekend and consider sharing pictures of the process. Our movement will grow if we can create a buzz around our Bee Buddies. People are welcome to volunteer with us by purchasing their own seeds directly and planting on Earth Day weekend. Please be sure to share your experience with us on our social media. Lastly, please consider joining us next year too, as we hope for this to be an annual event.",
