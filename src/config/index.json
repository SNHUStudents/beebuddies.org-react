The Bee Buddies campaign will focus on education and fundraising during March, and participants will plant their seeds on Earth Day Weekend: April 22nd, 23rd, 24th. We highly encourage our participants to reach out to their community and plant their seeds in an area that will benefit others. It’s important to note that all planting should be done with the landowners' permission. Participants are welcome to plant on their property if community planting is not possible. Become a Bee Buddy today and help feed the bees.",
